# Project description: WeLoveMovies
### Summary
WeLoveMovies is a web application which involed setting up a database and building out specific routes so that users can gain access to data about movies, theaters, and reviews. This project was created as my back-end capstone project for Thinkful's Software Engineering program.

Live: [https://movies-capstone-frontend.herokuapp.com](https://movies-capstone-frontend.herokuapp.com)

### Objective
By completing this project, I demonstrated my ability to build complex servers and access data through a database:

- Install and use common middleware packages
- Receive requests through routes
- Run tests from the command line
- Access relevant information through route and query parameters
- Create an error handler for the case where a route doesn't exist
- Build an API following RESTful design principles
- Create and customize a knexfile.js file
- Create a connection to your database with Knex
- Write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server
- Return joined and nested data with Knex
- Write database migrations using Knex's migration tool
- Deploy your backend server to a cloud service

### Technologies
PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express.js, Knex.js, Heroku

### Installation
